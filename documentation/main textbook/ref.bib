abstract="This paper explores the appropriateness of utilizing Linked Data as a knowledge source for content selection. Content Selection is a crucial subtask in Natural Language Generation which has the function of determining the relevancy of contents from a knowledge source based on a communicative goal. The recent online era has enabled us to accumulate extensive amounts of generic online knowledge some of which has been made available as structured knowledge sources for computational natural language processing purposes. This paper proposes a model for content selection by utilizing a generic structured knowledge source, DBpedia, which is a replica of the unstructured counterpart, Wikipedia. The proposed model uses log likelihood to rank the contents from DBpedia Linked Data for relevance to a communicative goal. We performed experiments using DBpedia as the Linked Data resource using two keyword datasets as communicative goals. To optimize parameters we used keywords extracted from QALD-2 training dataset and QALD-2 testing dataset is used for the testing. The results was evaluated against the verbatim based selection strategy. The results showed that our model can perform 18.03{\%} better than verbatim selection.",

title="Parsing Korean Case Phenomena in a Type-Feature Structure Grammar",
booktitle="Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing",
year="2005",
publisher="Springer Berlin Heidelberg",
address="Berlin, Heidelberg",
pages="60--72",
abstract="For a free-word order language such as Korean, case marking remains a central topic in generative grammar analyses for several reasons. Case plays a central role in argument licensing, in the signalling of grammatical functions, and has the potential to mark properties of information structure. In addition, case marking presents a theoretical and computational test area for understanding the properties of the syntax-morphology interface of the language. This is why it is no exaggeration to say that parsing Korean starts from work on the case system of the language. This paper reports the case system of the Korean Phrase Structure Grammar (KPSG) developed as a Korean resource grammar for computational purposes and implemented in the Linguistic Knowledge Building (LKB) system. The grammar adopts the constraint-based mechanisms of feature unification and multiple inheritance type hierarchies as an extension of HPSG (Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar) and is proved to be empirically and computationally sound and efficient.",
